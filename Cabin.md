In 2018, my friends and I built a 200 square foot cabin in the woods on [Vashon Island](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Vashon,_Washington) that took about three weekends to frame. We then spent another two months completing tasks like finishing the roof and installing a stove. This article will describe how to do this and things to keep in mind. 

### What I wish I knew when I started
These are some of the things I wish I knew before starting this project.
* Always create a plan of your cuts. This saves a ton of time and reduces the chance you'll waste wood
* Make sure you have a good circular saw and chop saw. Straight cuts are essential for making things fit together. Cutting by hand with a saw feels traditional but the accuracy of cuts is really (**really**) bad. 
* make a list of everything you need when you go to the hardware store. Its so easy to forget one minor thing that ends up holding up your project at critical moments. Always go through the work for the day when at the hardware store and ask yourself _what are all the tools I need for the coming project_ and then go step-by-step through the project to make sure you're not missing something
